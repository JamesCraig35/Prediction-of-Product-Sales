This project provides data analysis and insights on a grocery chain.  The goal of the project is to create a model which can predict outlet sales.  There is EDA focused on the features relationship to the target (outlet sales).
The heatmap provides correlation insights. There is a moderate correlation between MRP and outlet sales. Also, there is no correlation between the outlet establishment year and outsales. 
There are two models in the project: Linear Regression and Random forest decision tree.  
The Linear Regression model can preict outlet sales within a mean average error of +/- $804 on testing data. 
The random forest model is slighly more effective at predicting outlet sales with a mean average error of $735 on testing data.

This project provides data analysis and insights on a grocery chain.  The goal of the projct is to create a model which can predict outlet sales.  There is EDA focuses on the features relationship to the target (outlet sales).
The heatmap provides correlation insights. There is a moderate correlation between MRP and outlet sales. Also, there is no correlation between the outlet establishment year and outsales.  This suggests that there is little insentive to build new outlets.  
There are two models in the project: Linear Regression and Random forest decision tree.  
The Linear Regression model can preict outlet sales within a mean average error of +/- $804 on testing data.  This is a decent model considering the values range up to $13,000.
The random forest model is slighly more effective at predicting outlet sales with a mean average error of $735 on testing data.
